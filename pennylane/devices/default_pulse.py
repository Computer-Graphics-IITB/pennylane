    Args:
        wires (int, Iterable[Number, str]): Number of subsystems represented by the device,
            or iterable that contains unique labels for the subsystems as numbers (i.e., ``[-1, 0, 2]``)
            or strings (``['ancilla', 'q1', 'q2']``). Default 1 if not specified.
        shots (None, int): How many times the circuit should be evaluated (or sampled) to estimate
            the expectation values. Defaults to ``None`` if not specified, which means that the device
            returns analytical results.
        dt (float): the time step used by the differential equation solver to evolve the
             time-dependent Hamiltonian.
        dim (int): dimensions of the system (2 for qubits, 3 for qutrits, etc)
        drift(Operator): optional Hamiltonian term representing a constant drift term for the system Hamiltonian
